# Product Requirements Document  
Intelligent Test Management System (ITMS) – Desktop App  

## 1. Executive Summary  
ITMS is an all-in-one desktop solution that streamlines test planning, execution, result tracking, and defect management. By combining intuitive, “smooth interactive” UX with AI-driven insights, the product boosts QA productivity, elevates software quality, and improves cross-team collaboration.

## 2. Problem Statement  
Current QA workflows are fragmented across spreadsheets, standalone defect tools, and manual reports, causing:  
- High effort to create, update, and locate test assets  
- Slow, error-prone result logging and defect reporting  
- Limited real-time visibility for managers  
- Low reuse of historical data for predictive analytics  
A unified, intelligent platform is required to close these gaps.

## 3. Goals and Objectives  
Primary Goal  
• Provide a single, intelligent workspace for end-to-end test management.  

Secondary Goals  
• Accelerate test asset creation and maintenance  
• Reduce repetitive manual work via automation suggestions  
• Improve decision speed with real-time dashboards  
• Enhance team communication through built-in collaboration  

Success Metrics  
• 40 % reduction in test preparation time (survey)  
• 30 % faster defect turnaround (Jira timestamps)  
• ≥90 % weekly active QA users after 3 months  
• <2 sec average screen response under 5k concurrent cases  

## 4. Target Audience  
Primary Users  
• QA Engineers / Testers – daily creation, execution, logging  
• QA Leads – planning, resource allocation, quality metrics  

Secondary Users  
• Developers – view/confirm defects, link code changes  
• Project/Product Managers – release go/no-go decisions  
• Business Analysts – verify requirement coverage  

## 5. User Stories (sample)  
- As a QA engineer, I want inline editing of test steps so that I update cases without page swaps.  
- As a developer, I want failed test logs auto-attached to Jira issues so that I can reproduce bugs quickly.  
- As a PM, I want a release dashboard showing pass rate and critical defects so that I judge shipment readiness.  
- As a QA lead, I want AI to propose regression suites impacted by recent commits so that I focus on high-risk areas.  

## 6. Functional Requirements  
### 6.1 Core Features (MVP)  
1. Test Case Management  
   • CRUD with fields: title, prereq, steps, expected, priority, tags, status  
   • Version history & rollback  
   • Advanced search & multi-filter  
   Acceptance: user edits case inline, change logged in history panel.  

2. Release & Suite Planning  
   • Define release/iteration objects  
   • Drag-and-drop cases into suites  
   • Assign executors, environments, due dates  
   Acceptance: suite shows aggregated status per release.  

3. Test Execution & Result Recording  
   • State selection: Pass/Fail/Blocked/Untested  
   • Failure detail: repro steps, screenshots, log files  
   • Offline execution → auto sync on reconnect  
   Acceptance: execution record visible in history within 5 sec.  

4. Defect Management Integration  
   • One-click defect creation inside ITMS or to Jira/Redmine via REST API  
   • Bi-directional status sync  
   Acceptance: Jira issue ID visible in test run row.  

5. Dashboard & Basic Reporting  
   • Real-time charts: progress %, defect density, tester workload  
   • Widget customization via drag-and-drop  
   Acceptance: dashboard updates within 3 sec after new result.  

6. User & Role Management  
   • Roles: Admin, QA, Dev, PM (RBAC)  
   • SSO via SAML/OAuth2  
   Acceptance: non-authorized user blocked from admin panel.  

7. Basic Collaboration  
   • Comment & @mention on cases, runs, defects  
   • Notification center (in-app + email)  

### 6.2 Intelligent & UX Enhancements (Phase 2+)  
- AI case generation from requirement text or source diff (NLP + AST)  
- Impact analysis recommending suites affected by latest commits  
- Failure hotspot prediction per module/sprint  
- Risk-based test prioritization report  
- Animated charts & smooth transitions (60 fps)  
- Real-time collaborative editing (OT/CRDT)  

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements  
Performance: <2 sec avg UI response; bulk import 10k cases <60 sec  
Security: AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit, OWASP Top 10 compliance  
Usability: onboarding ≤30 min; WCAG 2.1 AA accessible  
Scalability: handle 1 M cases, 500 concurrent active users  
Compatibility: Windows 10/11 desktop app, optional WebView for Mac/Linux  

## 8. Technical Considerations  
Architecture: Electron front-end + Node.js backend (desktop), microservice API layer (Go) for integrations.  
Database: PostgreSQL for relational data; Elasticsearch for search.  
AI Services: Python microservice with HuggingFace models, served via REST; TensorFlow Lite for on-device predictions.  
Integrations: Jira/Redmine (REST), GitLab/GitHub Webhooks, CI tools (Jenkins) via plugin SDK.  
Data Sync: gRPC channel for real-time events; local IndexedDB cache for offline mode.  
Deployment: Auto-update via Electron auto-updater; MSI installer for enterprises.  

## 9. Success Metrics & KPIs  
User Adoption: WAU/MAU, daily session length  
Quality Impact: Defect leakage to production ↓25 %  
Process Efficiency: Avg cycle time from defect detection to closure ↓30 %  
System Health: p95 API latency <300 ms; error rate <0.1 %  

## 10. Timeline & Milestones  
Phase 0 – Discovery (2 w): detailed spec, prototypes  
Phase 1 – MVP (12 w): Core Features 1-7, basic Jira sync  
Phase 2 – UX polish & CI/CD integration (8 w)  
Phase 3 – AI features & real-time collaboration (12 w)  
Beta Release: end of Phase 2; GA: end of Phase 3  

## 11. Risks & Mitigation  
Technical: AI accuracy low → provide manual override & feedback loop  
Performance: Desktop app bloat → code-split, lazy load modules  
Adoption: Users resist migration → CSV import tool, in-app tutorials  
Integrations: API changes in Jira → versioned adapter layer  

## 12. Future Considerations  
• Cloud SaaS edition for cross-platform access  
• Low-code test automation recorder  
• Marketplace for community plugins  
• Advanced analytics dashboard with anomaly detection  
• Expanded compliance modules (ISO 29119, FDA 21 CFR Part 11)
